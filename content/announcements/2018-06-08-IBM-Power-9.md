Freshly installed, Isambard has another couple of architectures available!

 

SSH onto a login node as normal, documented at https://github.com/UoB-HPC/GW4-Isambard/blob/master/docs/GettingStarted.md - Then SSH to `power-001` or `power-002`!

 

2x IBM Power System AC922:

*    2x 20-core 2.4 GHz (3.0 GHz Turbo) Power 9 CPU Little-Endian
*    256GiB DDR4
*    EDR Infiniband
*    2x NVIDIA "Volta" V100 GPU with NVLink

 

Current software:

*    Red Hat 7.5 (for IBM Power Little Endian)
*    IBM XL C/C++ 16.1.0
*    IBM XL Fortran 16.1.0
*    GCC 4.8.5
*    NVIDIA drivers 396.26 (Upstream)
*    NVIDIA CUDA 9.2
*    NVIDIA CuDNN 7.1.4
*    NVIDIA NCCL 2.2.13
*    Anaconda2 5.1.0
*    Anaconda3 5.1.0
*    POWER AI

 

Lustre is mounted via NFS at /lustre-nfs with /home, /projects/, /common mounted through this. In the near future I hope to have a direct Lustre mount without NFS, this is pending an upgrade to Isambard's Lustre filesystem.

 

PBS is not enabled on these nodes currently, we are looking into this! For now the nodes will be a free-for-all so please experiment considerately as-always!

 

Please provide feedback if you encounter any issues or have any requests!
