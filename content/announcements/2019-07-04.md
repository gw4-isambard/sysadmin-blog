A maintenance window for the GW4 Isambard service has shall open every Tuesday from 09:00 to 11:00. This includes the XC50 (XCI, Phase 2), CS400 (Phase 1), storage, software changes & hardware work.

Preferably disruption will be kept to a minimum and contained within this window. Unavailble nodes may be brought back online outside of this window to avoid prolonged degraded capacity.
