title: Skylake nodes installed
---

Following the removal of our Arm early access nodes, we have finally installed two nodes of Intel Skylake 2x Intel Xeon Gold 6152 "Skylake" 22-core @ 2.10GHz

Documentation: <https://gw4-isambard.github.io/docs/user-guide/phase1.html#intel-skylake>

Lustre is available and basic compilers such as GCC and Clang from the CentOS repositories have been installed.
