title: Isambard Hackathon #2 "Stoking The Fire"

The second Isambard hackathon "Stoking The Fire" ended yesterday after a day and a half of hacking on the second half of the top 10 most common Archer codes + the UM/NEMO. There were specialists for each of the codes, Cray compiler and performance engineers all the way from the USA and Cavium engineers.

 

I was really pleased to see the system handling the workload without incident and surprised that this time not a single node crashed! That alone makes the week it took to upgrade the ARM chips worth it!

 

There were bugs in some codes being run, there were even a couple of compiler and performance tool bugs discovered and raised with Cray; At this early stage every bug found is a step towards getting the platform closer to operational quality!

 

I mostly spent my time applying helping users use the system, applying hotfixes, investigating enhancement requests and eating the sandwiches. Although when asked for a build system, whose own upstream project had dropped 13yrs ago, I understandably chose to insist on deprecation!

 

The following codes were run successfully:

* CASTEP
* OpenFOAM
* SBLI
* UM & NEMO
* Molpro
* NAMD
* Hydro3D
* Bookleaf
